        <h1>Wordle+ Infinite: Play Unlimited Word Games Online</h1>
        
        <p>Welcome to <strong>Wordle+</strong>, the ultimate destination for fans of the viral word-guessing phenomenon. While the original game offers only one challenge per day, our version provides an <strong>Infinite Wordle</strong> mode, allowing you to sharpen your vocabulary skills without any limits.</p>

        <h2>How to Play Wordle Infinite</h2>
        <p>The rules of Wordle+ are simple yet addictive. Your goal is to guess a hidden five-letter word in six attempts or less. Each time you make a guess, the tiles will change color to provide clues:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Green:</strong> The letter is correct and in the right position.</li>
            <li><strong>Yellow:</strong> The letter is in the word but in the wrong spot.</li>
            <li><strong>Gray:</strong> The letter is not in the word at all.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Why Choose Wordle+?</h2>
        <p>Our platform is designed for enthusiasts who can't get enough of daily puzzles. Here is what makes Wordle+ special:</p>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Unlimited Gameplay:</strong> No more waiting 24 hours. Play as many games as you want in our Infinite Mode.</li>
            <li><strong>Hourly Challenges:</strong> If Daily is too slow and Infinite is too fast, try our Hourly mode for a fresh challenge every 60 minutes.</li>
            <li><strong>Dark & Light Modes:</strong> Play comfortably at any time of day with our customizable themes, including a colorblind-friendly mode.</li>
            <li><strong>Statistics Tracking:</strong> Keep an eye on your win percentage, current streak, and guess distribution to see how you improve over time.</li>
        </ol>

        <h2>Tips and Strategies for Success</h2>
        <p>To master Wordle+, start with a word that contains many vowels and common consonants like "ARISE," "CRANE," or "ADIEU." Avoid repeating letters in your first two guesses to eliminate as many possibilities as quickly as possible.</p>

        <h2>Perfect for Brain Training</h2>
        <p>Word games like Wordle+ are more than just fun; they are a great way to improve cognitive function, expand your vocabulary, and keep your mind sharp. Whether you are a linguistic expert or just looking for a quick mental break, Wordle+ offers the perfect balance of challenge and relaxation.</p>
